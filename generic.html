							<h2>Who are we?</h2>
						</header>
						<p>After being grouped together on a school project, Beyond Me, I, Matteo, and Ilyan explored and investigated the world's education problems, whether it's stress in our own developed countries, or extreme poverty in those nations who are corrupt. Through that, we created School4All. An organization dedicated to creating a win-win solution to our education-related problems. </p>
						<p>Working on this project made us realize how extremely lucky we are to be having the ability to write this and you having the ability to read this. Millions of people are illiterate, with people fighting for jobs to survive, while others simply give up and vanish, dying a crippling death. Education is an important necessity in our lives. We all know it. Yes, there are problems with everyday conventional school systems, but that doesn't make education any less necessary than it is now and always will be.</p>
						<hr />
						<h2>What are you going to do, then?</h3>
						<h3>To solve First World school-related stress and Third World lack of education, we came up with two extraordinary solutions.</h3>
						<h4>THE EXPLORE PROGRAM</h4>
						<p>School4All's unique Explore Program idea contains a variety of differences of most public and private school systems. Explore encourages mastery-based learning, with no homework and no grades (only feedback) to provide a better learning environment for children. Kids get to spend 1.5 hours a day exploring topics of interest and mastering hobbies. A versatile program like this is a perfect idea for students to start liking school.</p>
						<h4>MODERN EDUCATION FOR THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES (METW) ORGANIZATION</h4>
						<p>To help with education lacking in Third World countries, we are promoting an idea; the METW. An international organization between prosperous countries in an agreement to aid with education in certain Third World places where a lack of education is abundant. Our supplies could be used for such greater causes, instead of being wasted and disposed of in our own country.</p>
